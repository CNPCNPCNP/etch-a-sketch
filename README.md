This project is a basic sketchpad contained in a browser, built using HTML, CSS
and JavaScript. The intention is to develop and showcase my skills in front-end
web development. 

## Functionality

* Hover the mouse over the cells to draw
* Click the clear button to reset the sketchpad
* Enter a number between 10-100 to reset the sketchpad and resize it to have the given number of pixels on each side
